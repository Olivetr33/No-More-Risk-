# Contribution Guidelines

- Use 4 spaces for indentation in JavaScript files and end statements with semicolons.
- Keep existing CSS rules unchanged. New styles must not modify current selectors.
- Run `npm run setup` (or `./setup.sh`) before committing to install dependencies, lint, and test the code.
- Ensure tests and linter pass; fix issues before committing.
